							<h2>Creating a Web API with Rails (in <b>Stairs Lounge</b>)</h2>

							<h2>Creating Twitter Bots</h2>
							<p><b>Beginner-friendly!</b> Learn how to make programs that can tweet automatically! We'll go over using Python to access the Twitter API. We'll then learn about Markov chain algorithms and how you can generate text that sounds like something else (for example, generate political statements from historical speeches) and tweet that. This workshop is designed for people who know how to write code in Python but are otherwise beginners. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a great beginner hackathon project!<br>

				<h1>Resources</h1>
				<p><b>How do I get started?</b></p>
				<p>We recommend you check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9kgpU8-S0wMtNDSboo2GtL0Fr128fZ6F7mRMoksPKc/edit?usp=sharing">Hitchiker's Guide to MAHacks</a>. We provide detailed steps and resources to get started on your hack.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>I'm a newbie. Help!</b></p>
				<p>Two of our workshops, <b>Hackathons 101</b> and <b>Creating Twitter Bots</b> are perfect for beginners. If you're new to hackathons and programming, be sure to check them out! Check out our Hitchiker's Guide (above) and ask for a mentor's help (also above) if you need help! Also, consider submitting your project for the <b>Best Beginners</b> category. Good luck!</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Which workshops should I attend?</b></p>
				<p>All of them! Well, it depends on your goal and experience level. "Hackathon 101" is for beginners, while "Designing Products..." is for all levels. If you are planning to do a track, you should definitely attend the track workshop(s). If you are undecided about tracks, dropping in to each track workshop is a good idea. Beginners should go to "Creating Twitter Bots", while more experienced people who want to learn a more niche skill should go to "API with Rails". Lastly, anyone can come to our 3:00 PM workshop and the 6:00 PM workshop on pitching ideas.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>I have another question. What do I do?</b></p>
				<p>Ask us in the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mahacksiii/shared_invite/enQtMzE5NjI4MDUzNzY1LWZiMDdhMDg0ZjU1NjJhZDI1NTEwYjlmNjg0YjI1MWFiOGQ3MWYwMTIzMDIyZmM3OTQwOTg3MjhhYjc4OGJlNzk">Slack channel</a>. We will try our best to answer.</p>
